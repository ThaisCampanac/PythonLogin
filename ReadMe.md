**Documentation For the Project**
=================================
*Libraries Used*
----------------
1. PySimpleGUI
2. Webbrowser
3. PyAutoGUI
4. Pyinstaller

*Background*
------------
Everyday I have to login to certain websites for my university. I found
that opening every website and typing all of the login information -even if the username and password was saved is a hassle. Therefore, I decided that I will create an executable file written in python that will do that all for me.

*Features*
-----------
This exe features a GUI that allows the user to type in their username and password. Another feature, is that the program will do all of the mouse and keyboard mechanics to open the browser insert url and login to the appropriate website.
